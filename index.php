        <h2>What's Our Animation?</h2>
        <span>Clift Off!</span>
        <p>Clift Off is just a play on words for cliff and lift off. The first process of chosing our physic related animation was a quick brainstorm among our team members. We chose the physics behind driving off a cliff, and we talked to the animators and got there approval. From there, we needed to shoot a video for the animators. However, we had a few big problem. We don't have a car to drive off a cliff or an extra life. So we thought a toy car off a table would be a close second option. The first video is something that we filmed for the animators. It is on the top, with the animation. Please enjoy, and we hope you stick around to the next page so you can learn the physics behind the cliff jump.</p>
